# Boot2Root

## 🛡️ Project Overview
**Boot2Root** is a cybersecurity CTF designed learn system exploitation and privilege escalation.

The goal is simple:
> Gain root access on a vulnerable virtual machine by exploiting security weaknesses.

This is a documented step by step proccess to gain root access

## 🎯 Objectives

- Discover open services running on the target VM
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Understanding how each vulnerability works
- Exploit them to gain initial access
- Escalate privileges to become root
